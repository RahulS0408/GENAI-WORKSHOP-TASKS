# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is designed to enhance the process of generating answers using a knowledge base by first retrieving context through a similarity search and then using that context to generate the final response.

## Overview
The RAG pipeline consists of three main steps:
1. **Loading the Knowledge Base**: This step involves reading data from a text file to create a list of knowledge snippets. Each snippet serves as a piece of context for answering queries.
2. **Creating a FAISS Index**: The knowledge base data is transformed into vector embeddings using a local model (`SentenceTransformer`). These embeddings are then indexed using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a fast indexing library that enables efficient similarity search based on these embeddings.
3. **Initializing a Local Language Model for Response Generation**: The local GPT-2 model is initialized to generate responses based on the retrieved context. This model is set up using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library.
4. **RAG Pipeline Execution**:
   - **Retrieve Context**: Given a user query, the query is embedded using the same model used to generate embeddings for the knowledge base. This embedding is then used to search the FAISS index for the closest match, which serves as the context for generating the answer.
   - **Generate Answer**: The retrieved context, along with the user query, is used as input to the GPT-2 model. The model generates a response based on the context, aiming to answer the query as accurately as possible.

## Key Components
1. **Knowledge Base**: This is typically stored in a text file (`knowledge_base.txt`). Each line in this file represents a snippet of knowledge, which could be a fact, explanation, or a piece of data relevant to the domain of interest. The knowledge snippets serve as the foundation for retrieval and generation processes.
   
2. **FAISS Index**: FAISS is used to index the knowledge base data for fast retrieval based on similarity. Vector embeddings of the knowledge snippets are computed using the `SentenceTransformer` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), which is optimized for semantic similarity tasks. This enables efficient retrieval of context relevant to a given query.

3. **Local Language Model**: The GPT-2 model, loaded locally using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library, is used for generating responses based on the retrieved context. This model takes the context and user query as input and generates a coherent and contextually relevant response.

## How it Works
1. **Retrieve Context**:
   - For a given user query, an embedding is generated using the `SentenceTransformer` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
   - The query embedding is then used to search the FAISS index for the most relevant snippet of knowledge (context). This involves calculating similarities between the query embedding and the knowledge base embeddings stored in the FAISS index.
   - The snippet with the highest similarity score is returned as the retrieved context.

2. **Generate Answer**:
   - The retrieved context and user query are then combined and passed to the GPT-2 model.
   - The model generates an answer using the retrieved context, aiming to accurately respond to the query.
   - The output is formatted as a coherent response to the user’s query, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the answer.

## Advantages of the RAG Pipeline
1. **Contextual Relevance**: By first retrieving relevant context from the knowledge base, the RAG pipeline ensures that the generated answer is contextually relevant and not purely reliant on prompt-based generation.
2. **Reduced Model Bias**: The retrieval process helps mitigate model bias by introducing additional context into the generation process. This allows for more nuanced and accurate answers.
3. **Efficiency**: The FAISS index enables fast similarity searches, allowing for real-time retrieval and generation, even with a large knowledge base.

## Applications
The RAG pipeline can be applied in various domains, including question answering systems, interactive AI applications, and knowledge management tools, where retrieving and generating contextually accurate responses is critical. This approach is especially useful for scenarios where static knowledge or context is required for generating meaningful and accurate responses.

By combining retrieval and generation steps, the RAG pipeline provides a powerful mechanism for integrating context into the generation process, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.
