# GENAI-WORKSHOP-TASKS
This repository contains 10 essential tasks related to cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning models. The tasks cover a wide range of AI applications, from text classification to neural network quantization, using pre-trained models and state-of-the-art architectures.

## Tasks Included in This Repository

This repository includes the following tasks:

### 1. **Text Classification with Pre-trained Models**
   This task demonstrates how to use pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT for text classification. The focus is on adapting these models to real-world classification tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

### 2. **Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   This task showcases a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The model combines pre-trained generative models with a retrieval mechanism to answer user queries effectively.

### 3. **Image Captioning with Vision-Language Models**
   Implement image captioning using models like CLIP or other vision-language models that can generate descriptive captions for images.

### 4. **Summarization System with T5 or BART**
   This task implements a text summarization system using transformer models like T5 or BART. The system condenses long articles into concise summaries.

### 5. **Question Answering System Using Dense Retrieval + BERT**
   Build a question answering system that uses dense retrieval methods in combination with BERT for answering fact-based questions from a corpus of text.

### 6. **Text Generation with GPT-3 or GPT-4 and Fine-Tuning**
   This task uses GPT-3 or GPT-4 for text generation. The model is fine-tuned on specific datasets to generate human-like text for creative or practical applications.

### 7. **Text-to-Speech System Using Quantized Models**
   Implement a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using quantized models for efficient, high-quality speech generation from text input.

### 8. **Multi-lingual Sentiment Analysis Using Cross-lingual Models**
   Perform sentiment analysis on text in multiple languages using cross-lingual transformer models like XLM-R or mBERT. The goal is to classify sentiment across various languages with a single model.

### 9. **Few-Shot Learning for Image Classification**
   Implement a few-shot learning model for image classification, enabling the system to classify images with minimal labeled data using techniques like prototypical networks or meta-learning.

### 10. **Neural Network Quantization**
   Explore techniques for neural network quantization, which reduces the size of models and accelerates inference by converting weights and activations to lower precision.
