# Image Captioning with BLIP Model

This repository demonstrates how to generate captions for images using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure the necessary libraries are installed:

    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision transformers matplotlib
    ```

3. Place your images in a directory accessible by the script.

## How It Works

### Model Loading:
The BLIP model (`BlipForConditionalGeneration`) and its processor (`BlipProcessor`) are loaded from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Image Preprocessing:
The image is processed into tensors compatible with the model using the BLIP processor.

### Caption Generation:
The processed image is passed through the model to generate a caption.

### Visualization:
The image is displayed with the generated caption using Matplotlib.

## Usage

### Generate Caption for an Image

1. Place the image in an accessible path.
2. Update the `image_path` variable in the script with your image's path:

    ```python
    image_path = "/path/to/your/image.jpg"
    ```

3. Run the script to generate a caption.

### Visualize the Result

The script automatically displays the image along with the generated caption:

```python
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title(caption)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
